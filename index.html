            <p class="fs-3">Most people stop over in Meknes simply to make a trip to Volubilis, Morocco's most famous
                Roman-era site and
                one of the top historic tourist attractions in the country.

                Those who decide to linger on in the city after touring the ruins will be rewarded. Meknes is one of
                Morocco's Imperial Cities and offers a more laid-back medina experience than in Marrakesh and Fes.

                Meknes' easygoing nature means it's also one of the best places to visit and base yourself if you want
                to
                escape the bustle of Fes. The short (and regular) train network between Meknes and Fes makes it possible
                to
                visit Fes entirely on day trips from here.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-4">
                In Meknes itself, the architecture of the medina, the grandiose gateway of Bab el-Mansour, and the
                dazzling
                Mausoleum of Moulay Ismail are three of the top sights. This is also the closest base to the hilltop
                pilgrimage town of Moulay Idriss, one of this region's most beautiful villages.

                    <p class="fs-3">The ancient Roman ruins of Volubilis, about 29 kilometers from Meknes, are the main
                        tourist
                        attraction for Meknes.

                        This is Morocco's most famous Roman remnant and for good reason. Sitting atop a hill, with the
                        countryside rolling out below, the surviving columns and temple fragments of Volubilis are an
                        impressive and powerfully atmospheric site.

                        Although much that has been unearthed here is now on display in Rabat's Archaeology Museum, many
                        of the gorgeous and intricate floor mosaics in Volubilis' grand Roman villas have been left
                        in-situ, giving you a taste of the grandeur of wealthy Roman life.</p>
                    <p class="fs-4">The city's heyday was AD 24-285, when it served as capital for the Roman province,
                        and most of
                        the ruins date from this period of prosperity.

                        Of particular interest are the House of Orpheus, the House of the Athlete, and the House of the
                        Labors of Hercules, with their particularly well-preserved mosaics.

                        Volubilis is 32 kilometers north from Meknes.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p class="fs-3">Established in AD 788, the holy city of Moulay Idriss is named after the country's
                        most venerated saint and the Prophet Muhammed's great-great grandson, who founded the first
                        Moroccan state.

                        The city is built upon the rocky spurs of the Khyber and Tazga hills, about 29 kilometers north
                        from Meknes, with the buildings tumbling down the slopes dramatically..</p>
                    <p class="fs-4">For the faithful, this is an important pilgrimage center, and an annual religious
                        festival in August attracts thousands who pitch their tents around the town.

                        Although non-Muslims cannot enter the shrines of the town, you can wander up through the medina
                        (old town), with its narrow lanes all washed in pastel hues, to the hillside paths above and get
                        amazing rooftop views of the entire settlement.

                        Moulay Idriss is on the same road as Volubilis, so it can easily be visited either on the way to
                        or from the ruins.</p>

                    <p class="fs-3">Bab al-Mansour is the main gate between Meknes' medina and Imperial City districts.

                        It's an immense and finely detailed structure that many architectural experts proclaim to be one
                        of North Africa's finest examples of surviving gateways. Finished in 1732, it was built by
                        Sultan Moulay Ismail (though completed after his reign).

                        The intricate architectural detail on the gateway includes lavish use of zellige tiling and
                        stone carving work.</p>

                    <p class="fs-4">Today, the gate isn't actually open. Instead you enter and exit between the medina
                        and Imperial City through a neighboring, much smaller side gate. This allows you to fully admire
                        Bab al-Mansour's artistry unheeded by traffic .</p>

                    <p class="fs-3">This sumptuously decorated mausoleum was built to house the tomb of Sultan Moulay
                        Ismail, who made Meknes his imperial capital in the 17th century.

                        Moulay Ismail is one of Morocco's most famous rulers. It was under his reign that Morocco, as we
                        know it today, came into being, as he managed to take territory back from both the British and
                        Spanish.</p>
                    <p class="fs-4">The tomb's interior is a showcase of the glorious exuberance of Moroccan religious
                        decoration with intricate tilework, stucco decoration, and carved stonework.

                        The actual mosque is not open to non-Muslims, but you can enter the outer parts of the complex
                        and enter the tomb hall itself, which is the major attraction of the building.

                        Take your shoes off on entering, wear modest clothing, and don't forget to tip the guardian.</p>

                    <p class="fs-3">Meknes medina (Old Town) is a vibrant, bustling place full of local shopping souks
                        and twisty lanes.

                        The main entrance is through Place el-Hedim, a smaller and less chaotic version of Marrakesh's
                        Djemaa el-Fna.

                        For avid shoppers, this is prime hunting ground, with Souk Najarine offering plenty of textile
                        stalls and Souk Sebbat home to many traditional Moroccan craft shops, as well as clothing and
                        Morocco's famous slippers.</p>
                    <p class="fs-4">You should be able to get better prices here for handicrafts than in Marrakesh.

                        The 12th-century Grand Mosque with its distinctive green-tiled roof, sits right in the medina's
                        core, making navigation easy.

                        The medina is still encased by its crumbling walls, which in some sections are still fully
                        standing. They were built during the reign of Sultan Moulay Ismail, when he made Meknes his
                        capital.</p>

                    <p class="fs-3">The Imperial City district in Meknes has plenty of interesting old ruins to explore,
                        most dating from the reign of Sultan Moulay Ismail, when Meknes enjoyed its heyday as capital of
                        Morocco.

                        Most visitors are here to see the Mausoleum of Moulay Ismail, but if you have time, it's
                        worthwhile spending more time here.

                        The main square, once through the grand gate of Bab el-Mansour, is Place Lalla Aouda. From here,
                        it's a short walk to the Koubat Al Khayatine. This is the city's old ambassador building, and
                        today part of the building is open to the public, with a small photography exhibit on Meknes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-4">Around the corner is the Mausoleum of Moulay Ismail. Next door to the mausoleum is
                        the ruined 17th-century palace of Moulay Ismail known as Dar el-Kebir. </p>

                    <p class="fs-3">The Dar Jamai was built in 1882 as the residence of the illustrious Jamai family and
                        was converted into the Museum of Moroccan Art in 1920.

                        The museum retains the rich traditional decor of painted wood and sculpted plaster that were
                        popular interior flourishes for the 19th-century Moroccan higher-classes. There is also an
                        exquisite Andalusian-style garden outside..</p>
                    <p class="fs-4">The museum is devoted to arts and crafts of the region, and there are wonderful
                        examples of wrought ironwork and wood carving.

                        One of the rooms is set out as a typical example of a Moroccan reception room from the late 19th
                        century, which will give you some idea how the rich of Meknes lived during this period.</p>

                    <p class="fs-3">A rather long and dusty two-kilometer walk from Meknes' Imperial City district
                        brings you to the mammoth Heri es-Souani buildings, which once served as the Imperial City's
                        storage granaries and horse stables.

                        Originally up to 12,000 horses were stabled here, and the building is thought to have been much
                        larger than the layout you can see today.</p>
                    <p class="fs-4">The complex has only been partially restored and is roofless, but its arched
                        doorways and vaults are still intact.

                        The Heri es-Souani structure receives much fewer visitors than the sites in central Meknes, and
                        you can often be the only person there, making it a very atmospheric area to explore.</p>
                </div>

                    <h2 class="display-4 fw-bold fst-italic">10. Stroll the Souani Basin </h2>
                    <p class="fs-3">The Souani Basin (also known as the Agdal Basin) is a manmade lake that once
                        provided water to Sultan Moulay Ismail's gardens and was part of the sultan's impressive
                        aqueduct system that brought water into the city.

                        The huge exterior walls of the Heri es-Souani rim the lake's southwest side, creating an
                        impressive backdrop. If you want to visit both, head to the Heri es-Souani first and then time
                        your visit to the Souani Basin for sunset.

                        Today the lake comes alive at dusk, when local families head here to let the kids run off some
                        steam, picnic, and stroll the pathway that runs around the lake. </p>
